## Solution ðŸ¤©

#### What is the problem?

In JavaScript (as well as other languages), every function has specify a value to be returned.
The function is missing ```return```

``` js
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```
This function can also be written on one-liner code using the arrow function.

```js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b
```
